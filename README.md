A Kaggle starter competition. With the MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") data set for computer vision. This repository contains all of the files pertaining to my attempt at 90% accuracy on a test set. This competition is like the "hello world" of computer vision. This is a practice for my machine learning skills.
